 MAVEN-MARKET-ANALYSIS-Project with PowerBI-
 
Maven Market is a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States. You have to perform the task of connecting and shaping the source data, building a relational model, adding calculated columns and measures, and designing a report using different visuals. Refer to the following files in the MavenMarket_dataset folder on Teams:

MavenMarket_Calendar.csv
MavenMarket_Customers.csv
MavenMarket_Products.csv
MavenMarket_Regions.csv
MavenMarket_Returns_1997-1998.csv
MavenMarket_Stores.csv
MavenMarket_Transactions_1997.csv
MavenMarket_Transactions_1998.csv

Process

1. Data Gathering

Describe how and where you obtained the Maven market data. Include details about the data sources, APIs used, or any data collection methods. For example:
Extracted Maven market data from the Maven API.
Compiled historical sales and customer data from internal databases.

3. Data Cleaning

Outline the steps taken to clean the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Mention any challenges encountered and how you resolved them. For instance:
Removed duplicates and resolved missing or inconsistent data entries.
Standardized data formats (e.g., date formats, currency symbols).

4. Data Transformation

Explain how you transformed the cleaned data into a format suitable for analysis in Power BI. This may involve data aggregation, normalization, or structuring data for efficient querying. For example:
Aggregated daily sales data to monthly totals.
Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer acquisition cost (CAC) and customer lifetime value (CLV).

5. Feature Engineering

Detail the techniques used to create new features or derive additional insights from the data. This could include creating calculated columns, measures, or utilizing Power BI's DAX language for advanced calculations. For example:
Implemented a churn prediction model based on customer behavior data.
Analyzed customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

7. Dashboard Creation
   
Describe the process of creating interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize and present your findings. Highlight the key visualizations and insights displayed on your dashboard. For example:
Developed a comprehensive sales dashboard with interactive charts showing trends over time.
Designed a customer analytics dashboard showcasing demographic insights and purchase patterns.
