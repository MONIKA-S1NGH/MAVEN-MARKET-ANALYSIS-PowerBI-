 MAVEN-MARKET-ANALYSIS-Project with PowerBI-
 
Overview
This project leverages Power BI for analyzing Maven market data to derive insights that drive organizational growth and strategy.

Process

1. Data Gathering

Describe how and where you obtained the Maven market data. Include details about the data sources, APIs used, or any data collection methods. For example:
Extracted Maven market data from the Maven API.
Compiled historical sales and customer data from internal databases.

3. Data Cleaning

Outline the steps taken to clean the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Mention any challenges encountered and how you resolved them. For instance:
Removed duplicates and resolved missing or inconsistent data entries.
Standardized data formats (e.g., date formats, currency symbols).

4. Data Transformation

Explain how you transformed the cleaned data into a format suitable for analysis in Power BI. This may involve data aggregation, normalization, or structuring data for efficient querying. For example:
Aggregated daily sales data to monthly totals.
Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer acquisition cost (CAC) and customer lifetime value (CLV).

5. Feature Engineering

Detail the techniques used to create new features or derive additional insights from the data. This could include creating calculated columns, measures, or utilizing Power BI's DAX language for advanced calculations. For example:
Implemented a churn prediction model based on customer behavior data.
Analyzed customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

7. Dashboard Creation
   
Describe the process of creating interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize and present your findings. Highlight the key visualizations and insights displayed on your dashboard. For example:
Developed a comprehensive sales dashboard with interactive charts showing trends over time.
Designed a customer analytics dashboard showcasing demographic insights and purchase patterns.

9. Insights and Findings
    
Summarize the significant insights and findings that emerged from your analysis using Power BI. Explain how these insights can impact business decisions and contribute to organizational growth. For instance:
Identified a correlation between promotional campaigns and sales spikes, suggesting effective marketing strategies.
Discovered geographic trends in customer preferences, guiding localized marketing efforts.
Conclude with a brief summary of the project's impact and potential future directions for analysis or improvements.
